        This free notification service automatically monitors the Embassy of
        Japan in Singapore&apos;s website for any available booking slots for
        tourism visa applications, and sends out email notifications to our
        subscribers the moment a slot becomes available.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I created this service because I had the same problem when applying for
        my Japan tourist visa. The embassy had turned off the waitlist feature,
        making it nearly impossible to secure a slot without paying exorbitant
        agency fees to do it for you. I knew there had to be a better way, so I
        created a service that could automatically monitor the embassy&apos;s
        website and notify me when a slot became available. I&apos;m sure there
        are many others who are in the same situation, so I decided to make this
        service available for everyone.
