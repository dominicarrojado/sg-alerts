        gives you the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore. All vehicles
        in Singapore require a COE. To register a vehicle, you must first place
        a bid for a COE in the corresponding vehicle category. A successful COE
        bid gives you the right to own a vehicle that can be used on the road
        for 10 years.

        system is a monthly auction where bidders outbid each other to obtain a
        COE during the bidding exercise by keying in the reserve price. The
        reserve price is the maximum bid amount that a bidder is prepared to pay
        for the COE. The bidding process is conducted by the LTA and the results
        are published on their OneMotoring website.

      <Paragraph>
        Bidding exercises usually start at 12pm on the first and third Monday of
        the month, and last for 3 working days. The exercises end in the same
        week, at 4pm on Wednesday, if there is no public holiday in between. If
        you are thinking of buying a vehicle, it is important to keep track of
        the COE premiums so that you can make an informed decision.
